# JVideo Chrome Extension
A simple Google Chrome extension for video isolation/download working on most web video providers like Openload, Streamango, Vidoza, Flashx,...

## Why JVideo?
Many web video providers prevent you from watching their videos comfortably due to abusive ads, cryptocurrency during playing, etc.

In most cases they do not allow you to download the videos either.

JVideo solves these two problems:

* It allows you to open a new video tab without anything else (ads, iframes,...) by getting the \*.mp4, \*.mkv video link.

* It allows you to download the page video by getting the \*.mp4, \*.mkv video link.


## How to use
First, you must open a tab and go to a web page with a embedded video. Sometimes it will be necessary to start playing it so that the page loads the video.

Then, you can press the JVideo icon, and if JVideo detects a compatible video, you'll see a green label saying **VIDEO DETECTADO**, then you can press:

* **VER VIDEO**: To open a new tab with the video from the current tab and anything more.
* **DESCARGAR VIDEO**: To start downloading the video from the current page.

## Tips
Once you opened the video in a new tab wit JVideo, you can go fullscreen with **F11** key, or download the video with **CTRL+S**.

## Legal
You should not use JVideo for download of copyrighted content, illegal content, pornography sites, or at any web page where video download is explicitly unallowed.

This limitation is informative but not functional. JVideo should work with most web video providers and contents including the exposed above.

## Limitations
Some few web video providers (including the well known *Youtube*, and *Vimeo*) doesn't use simple \*.mp4/\*.mkv embedded videos, and JVideo won't be able to get a video link, showing the label **VIDEO INCOMPATIBLE**.
